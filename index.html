        <h1>Are the Academy out of touch?</h1>
        <div class="para">Every year the Academy Awards roll around, and people talk about how the Academy voters are out of touch with the general cinema-going population. Accusations that they are only interested in giving ‘oscarbait’ films the Best Picture Oscar are abound. But how true is that?</div>
        <h2>Consensus through the decades</h2>
        <div class="para">I have taken data from the aggregate review site MetaCritic, and compared their Critical (Metascore) and Audience (User Score) ratings for every film nominated for Best Picture in the last 40 years. The following visualisation displays how many times by decade a group’s highest rated film for a given year also won the Best Picture Oscar.</div>

        <h3>Critic versus Audience Consensus</h3>
        <div class="para">The following visualisation takes a more in depth look at a subset of the data used in the first visualisation. It displays the aggregate rating from either group for each Best Picture Nominee for the years 1996-2021. You can switch between the two group’s ratings by using the buttons on the right, and can explore the films nominated each year by clicking the vertical grey boxes. </div>

                <div id="empty">In 2009 the Academy changed the rules around the Best Picture award, increasing the number of nominees to ten and introducing a modified version of instant runoff voting, a change which some suggested would allow more generic films to win.</div>
